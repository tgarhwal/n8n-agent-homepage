  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: [Insert Date]</em></p>

  <p>n8n Agent ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and share information when you connect your Google account through our workflow automation platform.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you connect n8n Agent to Google services (like Google Calendar), we may access and use the following data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Calendar events and metadata (event titles, times, attendees, etc.)</li>
    <li>Email address associated with your Google account</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We <strong>do not</strong> collect or store your data on our own servers. All automation workflows are executed within your own n8n instance.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your information solely to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Enable calendar-based triggers</li>
    <li>Support workflow automation between Google Calendar and connected apps</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your data is <strong>never</strong> sold or used for advertising purposes.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Access</h2>
  <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties except as required to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fulfill your automation workflows</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We follow industry best practices to ensure data flows securely through encrypted connections. However, since automations run in your self-managed environment, we recommend following n8nâ€™s security guidelines.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
  <p>You may revoke access at any time via your Google Account settings. This will immediately stop all automation actions involving your data.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns, contact us at: <br>
